Models module for MBridge package.

This module provides specific bridge implementations for various language models.
Each bridge class handles the conversion between Hugging Face model formats and
Megatron-Core, with model-specific adjustments.

Classes:
    Qwen2Bridge: Bridge implementation for Qwen2 models
    Qwen3Bridge: Bridge implementation for Qwen3 models
    LLaMA2Bridge: Bridge implementation for LLaMA2 models
    DeepseekV3Bridge: Bridge implementation for DeepseekV3 models
    MimoBridge: Bridge implementation for MIMO models
